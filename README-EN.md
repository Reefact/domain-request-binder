# Request Validation

A tiny library that provides a simple solution for validating requests (queries and commands) - as DTOs - and converting their properties into Value Objects. Very useful as part of a CQRS or Model Driven Design approach. 

## Presentation

Thanks to this library:

- benefit from a high level of decoupling between your API contracts and your domain requests (queries, commands) ;
- design scalable, flexible and easily testable architectures, without being tied to any fat framework, available in a wide range of .Net versions;
- take advantage of the independence and freedom offered by our library, concentrating on the design of your domain and accelerating the development process. Simplify your projects, reduce dependencies and take your code to the next level.
